                         LEGAL NOTICES      

  The project "docker-mail" is a work that contains many third-party
projects. This text is not a legal document but rather a notice based
on the interpretation of the the third-party projects' licence
documents.

                 Notice Regarding Included Works

  There are several other projects that either are either, contained
in the source code, or will be included into the non-source form during
compilation. The GNU General Public License does not apply to these
works. Instead, you should see their own individual licenses regarding
those works.

               Notice Regarding Used 3rd-Party Works

  In the context of the docker-mail project, "used" 3rd-party works are
works that are used in the project but not included directly in the
source. Instead, the location of the sources of these works are
referenced and used during the build/compilation process and therefore
may be included in any binary releases.
